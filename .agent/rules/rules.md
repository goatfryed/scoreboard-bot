# Cursor Rules

## Coding Guidelines
- **No Redundant Comments**: Never write JSDoc or inline comments that add zero value if the purpose, parameter types, and return types are already clearly defined by the TypeScript signature. Comment only when explaining non-trivial logic, mathematical formulas, or complex design decisions.
- **Environment Configuration**: Always store configurations, secrets, and other settings in the `.env` file rather than hardcoding them or forcing them solely as command-line options.
- **Top-Down Function Ordering (Stepdown Rule)**: Order functions from highest abstraction to lowest. Place public entrypoints / higher-order functions at the top of the file, and lower-order helper functions underneath them so the code reads like a top-down narrative.
- **Sensitive Files Access**: Never view or read `.env.local` or `credentials.json`. Always respect user privacy regarding secrets and configurations in those files.

## Execution guidelines
- **Never run node commands**, ask the user to execute them on terminal.
